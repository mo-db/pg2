# setup
- x86-64 Debian Utm -> for valgrind, gdb, testing
  - setup git and ssh
- able to compile c, cc, asm with make

# Libraries
- in posix librariy names have to start with `lib`
- static:
  - `ar r libExample.a file1.o file2.o` -> somewhat like a compressed zip
  - `ranlib libExample.a` -> indexes the functions so they can be used
  - `-L. -lExample` search for the example lib in current dir
- dynamic:

# Compilation and Build process
- use shell -> use make -> use cmake
- give a compiler all source files without flags
- `-c` just compile without linking
- Makefile.am -> `automake` -> Makefile.in -> `configure` -> Makefile

## Keywords
- `extern` -> declare something that is outside the current `uebersetzungseinheit`
  so not int the header or a same named source but in a library or such
  - `erno` is a global posix variable, to use it it has to be declared as extern


## Object
- data and action associated
- size, type, allignment, storage duration, lifetime, value, name

## Funciton
- collection of statements

## Statement
- ends in ;
- can compile into many machine lang instructions
- Types:
    Declaration statements
    Jump statements
    Expression statements
    Compound statements
    Selection statements (conditionals)
    Iteration statements (loops)
    Try blocks

## Containers [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container]
- containers are `homogeniouse`
- implemneted as `class templates`
- if something is called container, it fullfills the requirements here:
  [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Container]
- C++ array data types:
  - (`C-Style array`) no c++ container
  - `std::vector`, most flexible
  - `std::array`, more limited than vector, but more performant

## Classes
- classes have `member functions`

## initialization [https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/variable-assignment-and-initialization/]
- types of initialization:
  - default: `int x;`
  - copy: `int x = 5;`, great since c++17
  - direct: `int x ( 5 );`, used for some explicit things
  - list: `int x { 5 };`, modern, used with std::vector, does not allow
    narrow conversion:
    - compiler error if try to init value that variable can not 
      savely hold -> initializing an int with a floating point number
  - value: `int x {};`, list 0 initialization 

# Debugging & Errors
- Segfaults are good
- `-fsanitize=address` is as good as valgrind
- `-DNDEBUG` takes all asserts out of executable
  - so `assert(do_stsuff() == true)` is not ok

# Compiler, runtime, compile-time
## Optimization
- turnd off by default for better debugging
- `profiler` to check time neede for functions
- `optimizer` enhances code, example: i = i * 2; into i <<= 1;
  - modern C++ compilers have builtin optimizers 
  - `as-if-rule`: compiler can refactor to optimize code however it wants,
    but observed behavour of the code must remain unchanged
  - `compile-time evaluation` of expressions = performance increase
    - `constant folding` replace (3+4) with 7
    - `constant propagation` replaces variables with their constant values
      if they not change trough the programm to not have to access memory
      - so constant variables help the compiler to optimize better
    - `dead code elimination` removes unused code
## runtime, compile-time
- `compile-time debugging` is underdeveloped in C++
- `compile-time constants`: const int b { 5 }; const int d { b };
  - literals
  - objects with compile-time initializer constants
- `runtime constants`: int a { 5 }, const int e { a }; const int f { e };
                        const int g { five() };
  - constant function parameters
  - objects with non-constant or runtime constant initializers


# Identifiers and Names
- start with a-zA-z_

# Utilities library [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility]
## Function Object - functor
- function with state - functions are normally not objects

# I/O library [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io]
## basic_ios
- facilities to interface with `std::basic_streambuf` objects
## basic_ostream [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ostream]
- cout, cerr, clog
## basic_istream [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_istream]
- cin

# Facts
- C: `call by value` -> objects are copied in and out of scopes
- C: `argv[argc] = 0`, `argv[argc+n]` -> environment information
- a pointer with value 0 is `nullptr (NULL)`
  - `*(int *)0 = 0;` is a nullptr dereference -> segfaults
- C has printf < C++ iostream < std::format < std:print < fmt (lib)
- dont use malloc() and free() in C++
- `\r` is carriage return, gets to start of line
- `literals (literal constants)` are fixed values int the executable
  while `variables` are placed into memeory
- `implicit` (automatically by the language/compiler) -> type promotion
- `explicit` (intentionally coded by the programmer) -> type cast
- `%` opperator not math like for negative numbers: -21 % 4 = 1
- `$?` -> result of last terminated process

# Recursion
- recursive function stack: `ulimit -s` 8mb, `ulimit -s unlimited`
- ever recursion problem can be solved iteractive (for/while)
  - for non-trivial problems recursion can be simpler to write and read
  - fibonacci for example -> `EX` try iteractive and recursive fibonacci 

# Unix commands
- locate, same as `find /path -name <name>` but can prebuild

# Need to learn about
- STL containers
- iterators, containers and algorithms
- templates, generics (function and class templates)

## 01 - Basics
- 01: rev
  - `statements` -> instructions, can be executed by the program, end in `;`
    - declaration, jump, expression, compound, selection, iteration, try block
  - `function` -> collection of statements
- 10: rev
  - `expression` -> non-empty sequence of literals, variables, operators and
    function calls that `evaluates` (gets executed) into `result`
## 05 - Constants and Strings
- 04: !rev
  - compiler has built in `optimizer`, that operates after the `as-if-rule`
  - `compile-time evaluation`
    - contant folding, constant propagation, dead-code elimination, ...
  - `compile-time vs runtime`
- 05: !rev
  - `compile-time programming` -> using language features that result in
    compile-time evaluation of code -> need constant expressions
    - constexpr variables, constexpr functions, templates, static_assert, ...
  - `constant expression` -> contains only compile-time constants
    - can not be used in constant expression:
      - non-const variables, const non-integral variables (use constexpr),
        return values of non-constexpr functions, function parameters,
        new, delete, throw, typeid
    - if no constant expression is required in a specific context,
      compiler `must not evaluate at compile-time`
- 06: !rev
  - c styele `const` -> difficult to tell if var is constant in some situations
    - only use if initializer is not a constant to indicate variable not change
  - `constexpr` is always a compile time constant
    - initializer must be a constant expression -> else compilation error
    - function parameters of normal functions cannot be constexpr
## 09 - Debugging and Errors - check
- 01: rev
- 02: !rev
  - `code coverage`: state, branch, loop, ...
- 03: rev
- 04: rev

- 05: rev
- 06: !rev
  - `static_assert` to trigger assert at compile-time

## 19 - Dynamic Memory Management

  - 

## 11 - Function Overloading and Class Templates
- 01: rev
  - `overloading` -> name identical functions with diffent parameter types
- 02: rev
  - `differentiation` based on number of parameters, types of parameters.
    The return type doesn't matter here.
- 03: !rev
  - compiler does `overload resolution`
  - `ambigious function call` -> compiler cant differentiate
- 04: !rev
  - define function as `deleted` if it should not be callable with a specific
    combination of types
  - `deleted function templated` to make a function only callable with 
    the specific type that is defined
- 05: !rev
  - `default argument` is used if caller provides no argument
- 06: !rev
  - compiler uses `template` to `generate overloaded functions`
  - templates can use `placeholder types`
  - templates can work with `types that did not exist` when template was written
  - declaration: `template <typename T>`
- 07: !rev
  - calling: `some_function<actual_type>(arg1, arg2);`
  - functions `instanciated` from a template are called `specialization` or
    `instanciated functions` and this template is the `primary template`
  - can use template argument deduction `some_function<>(arg1, arg2)`
    or even `some_function(arg1, arg2)`
  - template functions can have `non-template parameters`
  - template usage is called `generic programming`

## 28 - I/O [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/manip]
- 01: !rev
  - `std::cout` and `std::cin` use stdin and stdout under the hood

  - classes:
    - istream, ostream, iostream, standard stream (cin, cout, cerr, clog)
- 02: !rev
  - `<<, >>` operator skip whitepaces
